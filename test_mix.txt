Mr President, I cannot, of course, agree with the previous speaker, who like a typical socialist can only see the downside when it comes to tax-free sales.I call on the Commission to do its utmost to combat and finally put a stop to this truly shameful form of tourism.
The rest will be ironed out by national laws.
The common position says no to comitology for adaptations to technical progress, but yes for adaptations to horizontal foodstuffs legislation.
That is something which the Commission and the Council should look at.
The resolution by the Committee on Institutional Affairs is right to recommend qualified majority voting and to balance subsidiarity with solidarity.That is why I think we should adhere to this position.
... perhaps in many other regions too: I have also seen holdings of this kind in Andalusia, Mr Colino.
At present, the guidelines on good clinical practice are intended purely for information and not enforced in the same way in individual Member States, which are responsible for legislative regulation.
The third is the transition to majority voting.
Let me repeat: we did not start working on this just today; we have been working on these issues for the last four years.The concern of our institution about cultural aspects was shared by the Council who specifically excluded any involvement of the procedure in the area of cultural policy and audiovisual.What we need is rules relating to employment and also to the immigration of foreign workers into the Union.We would have been delighted to continue the debate with the Council, with the Commission acting as facilitator, through the procedure of conciliation.Unfortunately, the proposal which British Prime Minister Tony Blair finally put to the Heads of State and Government at lunch on 2 May 1998 failed to meet with general agreement.Madam President, I wanted to inform you that 100 francs have disappeared from my petty cash.It is the Council that creates difficulties.She is much loved throughout Europe.That will also reduce the chances of mismanagement and fraud: the money can remain in the hands of the Member States.The stated objective is to simplify the procedure of claims settlements for injured parties by facilitating access to the other party's insurance company.
In this century, we have already seen terrible acts of the utmost cruelty.I cannot accept that we adopt a common salary and in the same breath continue to allow an expenses regime which is based on anything other than actual cost.
We are equally opposed to debt-collection agencies being granted additional rights in future, and being in a better position than lawyers when it comes to cross-border services.
What kind of long-term political strategy can be found to resolve these conflicts that will not lead to war, to expulsions, to mass violence and the trampling of human rights?I hope that this is not a reflection of the enlargement process on which I have two brief questions.
Let me remind Commissioner Bangemann of Parliament's position.But what we were told here was that it was not put to the vote because, of two versions, the other one was preferred.
We strongly protest against this procedure.
I am, to say the least, surprised that the Council seems either to be ignoring the role of Parliament or not to have been anticipating this debate.In the meantime it has become clear that, politically speaking, this veto right does exist.
The European Parliament expresses continued solidarity with the people of Northern Ireland and its new assembly in the on-going process of peace and reconciliation' .Mr President, the vote was not unanimous as I voted against the resolution.
I see that in the near future all those concerned, including my country, Finland, must be part of the WEU operation, as a result of equal and fully-fledged membership.We have achieved progress and something positive here.Madam President, this is not the first time that we have discussed the Internet, nor will it be the last.A provision has also been included which guarantees the right to strike.
We must not uncouple the debate, which is concerned primarily with amendments and examination of the various issues, from the vote.
Can we still give any credence to the meaning of words?
Compared with the enormous efforts that the applicant countries have made, the Council's approach has been far too laid back, in our view.But I do hope that it will not be necessary to go that far.
All contributions received were intended for use in coordination with the relevant UN organisations.I hope the Christmas break has given everyone time to reflect, and that the vote in Brussels on 28 January will lead to a revision of these amendments.I will now put to the vote the request to postpone the report by Mrs Karamanou.Mr President, the Danish referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty is now only two weeks away.Thirdly, simplified registration procedures need to be worked out in order to speed up the procedure for recognising homeopathic medicines.And throughout its history there has certainly been no shortage of proof of the opportunities for the Presidents of the Chamber after they have fulfilled their role of assigning cases.Major differences exist between Member States.
Mr President, I found the climate in this House fascinating last time this report came up.Mr President, I am very grateful to you, Mr Elliot, for asking this question because it gives me the opportunity to clarify a point.I certainly cannot allow us to restrict the reform to this one issue and concentrate on a reduction of subsidies instead of a full reform.Committee meetings have therefore become forums for the exchange of ideas, which has doubtless proved most useful to both the Commission's services and those of the Member States.The Commission is due to report back to ECOFIN next month on consultation with third countries.
I would also like the Commission to tell us why money is being spent via the 'big' funds, the Council of Europe and the United Nations.As far as Guatemala is concerned, Mrs van Putten, we do have the programme that I mentioned which deals with the children in Guatemala.So he should also be able to decide for himself whether to sit an aptitude test or to attend an adaptation period.
There have unfortunately been examples of this.We are in favour of absolute respect for the rights of prisoners and should like to stress the importance of rehabilitation and reintegration measures.
I am very sorry you did not get more detailed information and I will take the appropriate steps to arrange that as soon as possible.That is part of the problem that exists.This is said to contradict the spirit of the European Treaties because it can lead to cartel-like structures.
Approval of the Minutes
Although the decision, which has dragged on for some time, is an unsatisfactory compromise, it is the lesser of two evils.If we can agree on all the basic elements that would be the basis for the action from now on.
But tell me one political power in Serbia that holds a different position.
Enlargement cannot be allowed to introduce imbalance.
The Commission is prepared to apply the instruments of the Union's commercial policy where conditions dictate and in accordance with the relevant WTO agreements.
So what the Commission has to do now is show that these fines may perhaps not be enough to actually dissuade those broadcasters from breaking the rules.ECU 1 million has already been sent but it is obvious that more will have to be sent since the estimated needs are far greater than that.I would like to ask that the quorum be established.Tackling the problem posed by earlier nuclear weapons is a major step in this respect.
In the electricity sector we have already seen the first negative consequences of the Electricity Directive, not just for the environment but also for democracy.It focused unnecessarily on the Islamic religion, whereas it was meant to be a report on the problems associated with fundamentalism.
You have said that there is no risk.
On behalf of Mr Argyros, and also on my own behalf, I would like to thank all of you for your friendly cooperation with the rapporteur.Secondly, should we not look at what we are already doing for environmental protection, in other words the covenants?The residue standards must be clearly defined within the framework of international agreements and particularly in the WTO agreement.
We have abstained from the vote on this report because we believe that the common agricultural policy is in need of fundamental reform.However, the family has always been highly valued and will continue to be highly valued in all the countries of the European Union.
Yet what are we seeing at present?
If we truly believe and truly want a common statute there should be no transitional system.
Regional planning means better communications, greater attractions for industry and greater opportunities for growth.
Anywhere where this dreadful barbarity survives and has not been stamped out cannot claim to respect fundamental human rights.Finally, I commend the Commission for its initiative, and I hope Members will be able to support my resolution.Even in today's Financial Times I saw reference to a product of a French company which has launched a multipurpose CD duplicator.
However, we cannot accept the amendments of a budgetary nature.We too believe that there is little margin for improvement.It also provides for derogations but limits their duration to a five year period from 2008 onwards on the understanding that this derogation period is non-renewable.Our group was split on the vote last night and I am sure our group will be split on the vote on Thursday.40 000 people in the Union and 13 000 in Finland will lose their job.The debate is closed.
For all these reasons it is essential for us to upgrade bilaterally our relationship with the Republic of Korea.The Union must be prepared to anticipate the UN sanctions.The poet Neruda might have been able to alter one of his poems in the light of this situation to say that he could write the most joyful verses tonight.
Certain candidates for the Central Bank's Board have not conceded that monetary policy could have different effects in various parts of the euro area.
The UK presidency has misled all those who have been pleading for an effective control of arms exports.
By so doing, we save our resources and reduce our dependence on imports.
Moreover, certain aspects of Amendments Nos 3 and 5 cannot be accepted; neither can we accept Amendment No 7.Unlike many commentators on this subject, Minister, I personally am not surprised.However, I want to say a word about the HAARP Project Mr Gahrton mentioned.We should be moving towards a general and universal social insurance scheme for the elderly.
After Parliament's innumerable calls for this to happen, the European Council in Vienna finally asked the Commission to put forward proposals on experimenting with low VAT rates for labour-intensive services.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for her work and for having taken account of the various positions put forward in the committee.
It will consider all proposals to that end.
The main elements were defined by the Commission as measures to stem the tide of immigration, effective supervision of immigration and strengthening the position of legal immigrants.We therefore need to be as objective as possible, because very often the loudest voices are heard from those who do not themselves face any direct danger.The whole international community is trying to understand the current situation and to help Russia.The study was carried out in Italy, filed away and forgotten about, and it was concluded that the tiger would simply die out.I think the criteria used in the proposal need to be examined here, by all of us.
It also agreed on concrete measures for judicial cooperation and protection of witnesses.Against this background, the European Parliament last year launched its sixth and most recent push.
So the Commission thinks it is very important to adopt a comprehensive approach to all the legal bases in the budget.One thing which is certain is that we are not going to start a debate on the matter.In this way we could also help improve transparency of cost in the internal market in electricity.We must manage to ensure that a critical mass of minority-group refugees return, so that this becomes an irreversible process.
It has already been said that the cost of this programme is relatively low.Flexibility is needed essentially because we are talking about two different kinds of aid.You want to adopt Agenda 2000 at the March summit.This is an international issue which warrants joint action by the Member States.
At this point the road to common destiny opens for Europe: the European countries can no longer afford not to understand this.
All the indications are that a great many consumers are willing to pay extra and choose alternatively produced eggs.As I said at the beginning, most of the amendments propose very constructive changes to the existing text.At last we are discovering - or rather, rediscovering - that the Union too has a role to play.Mr Le Pen, I gave you three minutes.
We want to discuss the future WTO negotiations with the Americans, but has the impact of the Uruguay Round been felt?Not only do they not enjoy any budgetary advantages, but they do not benefit either from the preferential trading treatment granted, for example, to the countries of the Lomé Convention.
To Mustafa and Akim from Van and Diyarbakir, who were murdered by the Grey Wolves in Adana.
A small instrument with an astounding effect!
However, we obviously need to do more.
I emphasise that it is a good compromise.
I am actually optimistic about Europe.
Mrs Rothe's second, excellent report is along the same lines. It refers to the Commission White Paper, just as the Green Paper was referred to before.
It is superfluous and that is why it was not put to a vote.
But there are some that present enormous dangers, particularly those that are associated with traditional diseases, for example, the micro-organisms associated with things like bubonic plague.
The question arises: What kind of benchmarks?Then it unfortunately turns out that the airport, port, hospital, television station, radio or whatever cannot open.This is the situation with which we are faced.However, would a ban on the extreme right not be an extraordinary acknowledgement of political weakness, in view of the ambiguous fascinations which it exerts over part of public opinion?You may table as many motions for resolutions as you wish, but this time we are dealing only with a single person, and nothing else.
The problem, as I see it, is this.I ask you to rectify this immediately.It is a pity that a presidency is not viewed as representing Parliament as a whole rather than only one group.
A small airplane is depicted flying through clear skies.
a vase with a flower growing very well
All fishing interests oppose this, the chairmen of the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are against it.There is nothing of this sort at European level.In this case, that way has to be sought by ensuring a proper balance between rights and exceptions to those rights.The Council even went as far as to simply refuse to adopt a common position on the proposal for a regulation concerning the nomenclature.I felt it was rather inappropriate of Parliament not to have recognised that fact when we had rapporteurs and one or two other distinguished guests here with us.Certainly, the rapporteur deliberately omitted this problem which, I admit, goes beyond a purely religious problem, but other Christian forms of fundamentalism are at work in Europe.
I should like to know when I can now expect it to be dealt with.Unfortunately, the PES is not yet lucky enough to have me.However, it also demonstrates it is not only the interests of the producers that are coming to fruition here.If we do not do so, the employment plans drawn up in all the Member States will be of little use.Sociologists and demographers all agree that it is the family that binds together a social system.
Saddam's policy of starving his people for his own political gain must be unmasked as the inhuman policy it is.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are totally in favour of this extension of no-fault liability as proposed by the Commission.
The principle of additionality and proving its application when programmes are being approved continues to present problems at times.There are also rumours that the Katangan police are planning an operation from Angola to expel Kabila, who now symbolises the state of Congo, from Katanga.Others - Amendment No 15 and part of No 18 - would affect the Commission's existing competences.
The peace process remains in deadlock.
This principle would sidestep the risk of a "centrally-organized' Europe and allow us to "respect the spirit of local, regional or national needs in decisionmaking' .But we also need political will.This new wave of migration, which is growing every year, has led some countries to tighten their immigration laws.Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, this is not the time for an explanation of vote or a debate.I know many of you share our outrage at this.
Your comment concerned a linguistic correction, Mr Pompidou, and we must clearly do all we can to improve the text and make it more accurate.Set at the right level, environmental taxes and charges serve to enforce the extremely important polluter pays principle.Mr President, we in the Commission welcome today's debate on the means of seizing and confiscating the proceeds of crime.
We will not cease to fight unrelentingly for these principles.In addition, it also has an ecological purpose.
I have even done something which was perhaps not right in legal terms.
I voted against the report for the above reasons.
There are also Member States who want it.
As you all know, it is easy to agree on general issues but we all have different views when it comes to specific details.
Secondly, according to our information that firm has now bought a replacement slaughterhouse.Every long journey does, after all, begin with a small step.
Perhaps the fisheries policy is not such a common policy as the agricultural policy?
Without adherence to the strictest possible safety standards there can be no talk of accession to the European Union.There is no coordination in arms exports.I suppose the fact that the opinions of these committees are sought is some consolation, but in a general way this decision needs some sort of explanation.The alcohols produced must be suitable for the potable alcohol market in order to reduce the budgetary cost of this measure.It is a slow and difficult process because it also requires a secure environment.
Though having said that, this will probably finish him off if it gets back to Tony.
Mr President, I would like to draw the House's attention to the issue of nuclear safety, which is one of Agenda 2000's priorities.Let us prepare it!In fact, Europe has not one but several peoples; it has several traditions, several histories and several languages.
The social and human costs have been and still are enormous and unacceptable.Without it, the European Union will not manage to achieve Agenda 2000 and enlargement eastwards.It is well known that without a price adjustment, prospects for beef and veal on the home market are hopeless.I was also pleased to see the reactions of the Norwegian and Canadian Foreign Ministers in the International Herald Tribune, wishing us all courage.Much the same is happening now.The Ombudsman's efforts to clarify the concept are on the right track and should specify the respective duties of the Committee on Petitions and of the Ombudsman.You have done a great deal to combat hormone fraud in Belgium.We should remember this.Moreover, they have shown that together they will form a team worthy of Parliament's trust.There is no reason to suppose that it will not be.Moreover, the way in which the Commission is carrying out this task is quite remarkable, Commissioner.This has already been approved and it is mainstreamed.That is what I mean by the moment of truth in these important areas: legal cooperation and the fight against organized crime.We have heard about promoting the consumption of fish as a healthy food to support the fishing industry.The hospital is there; it is empty.
We believe there are sound arguments for adopting a different approach to intra-Community and international capital movements, including those to do with the free movement of capital and exchange risks.
Nor is it acceptable that less favoured areas have been forgotten in the new reallocation of quotas. These areas should have been included, along with the mountain regions.
What is more, it is setting a very dangerous precedent for other countries in Africa.
I asked to speak just after the Commissioner began.
So our view is 'brown Monti good, green Monti very, very good'.
The Edinburgh Summit did not endorse Parliament's proposal for a separate objective to deal with fishing.Not all of us have drawn up a national action programme to meet our commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity.
The Commission has largely met those conditions, which means that there is now nothing to prevent us from doing what we said in March, namely giving discharge.However, it is not at all about the document not being forwarded, but about the way in which this was refused.He brought this experience home to Ireland and asked people why, if the Germans, French and others can do it in Europe, we cannot do it in Northern Ireland.ApplauseI can see two candidates: a reformed IMF with more democratic voting or the Bank for International Settlements, which would first need to have a democratic supervisory board.
Article 3(3) suggests that afforestation and reafforestation measures could be taken into account in order not to reduce our quota of emissions.
Mr President, I have a point of order based on Rules 2, 5 and 119 of the Rules of Procedure.
The unification of Europe must involve a constant process of construction and consolidation.A dog is posing on top of a motorcycle. 
But here, too, there is a negative side because this figure is less than half as high as the American equivalent.
The point at issue is the difference between 'a reasonable time' and 'without any significant inconvenience' and 'an appropriate period having regard to...'It would be most important to internalise the cost of decommissioning power stations in electricity generation as a whole.
EC-Azerbaijan trade agreement
The consequences of European monetary union, of the euro and of enlargement to the east, on which our committee has often asked for information, are not mentioned.
There is still some controversy, even within the WTO, as to whether the adjustments made to the actual organisation of the EU markets meet WTO requirements.Secondly, when can we expect tangible results from research into the use of antibiotics in animal feed?Cat caught getting into the bathroom sink 
It is important that we have managed to do that while maintaining the cohesion of the Contact Group.Let me now turn to the individual amendments you have proposed.
The only sensible and ethical solution would have been to introduce real-cost reimbursement.But, unfortunately, we feel that this is merely window dressing.We must accept that Kosovo is important historically and traditionally to the Serb nation and we must not replace fear of one set of people by fear of another.
The statute for Members is a different matter altogether.
I would therefore appeal to the Member States to attach greater importance to collecting customs duties correctly, in their own interest.
The only problem you would have in getting them back is not whether customs stop you, it is actually carrying the bloody stuff.Details of abuse and improper conduct must be brought to light and the parties concerned must be brought to justice.More generally, the report on the Statute of the Members of the European Parliament has come at just the right time.If a coordinator steps down because he wants to operate in a different way, another coordinator is chosen, and in this case I was selected.That is what we think, anyway.
The joint debate is closed.In his first report he pointed out how many people had petitioned, and which petitions were not admissible.This directive will only make a difference if it can be applied to all actors and operators in all Member States.Mr President, I wish to address the same subject, with reference to Rule 96(1).
I am therefore certain that the Community and the Member States will devote their full attention to initiatives taken under the auspices of the UN.
One should not conclude from this, however, that others are not interested.Here industry and commerce play a clearly dominant role.
We have stressed the need to learn from one another.
Mr Fantuzzi wishes to speak.
However, the stability pact has restricted the ways in which the budget can be used.
We must put an end to this scapegoat strategy, for it is dangerous to manipulate immigration.
Obstacles to freedom of movement for workers are of a different nature.Mr Blak has the floor for a point of order, which I hope is indeed a point of order.I refer here to the European enlightenment which, since Antiphon and Hippias of Elis, has argued the basic idea of equal freedom.
What can we do?
They also highlight the significant change and the range and diversity of traditional telecommunications and media services.That is a very worrying sign for the European Union.... the President's own country.As you know, the Court of Auditors is repeatedly asked to provide opinions on proposed measures.There is a resolution of the European Parliament of November 1997.Secondly, there can be no European education policy without a European language policy.
UCLAF or OLAF should be a unit with quasi-legal powers, enabling international corruption and fraud dossiers to be tackled properly by the national courts.a guy that is on a bike on a road
It really is in this context that the report should be seen.Nothing can be done without this active role because, as in many fields, financial matters are at the heart of the debate.That is something different.To achieve this reduction in emission levels, environmental policy needs to be incorporated into other policy sectors, such as energy, transport and agriculture.
That is why my group, as we have already said, supports the Spanish and UK authorities for taking this courageous step.If that is not possible, is the President-in-Office of the Council admitting today that, for this reason, there may be a delay to the accession of Cyprus?
I am not going to be able to answer every question that has been raised.
It has also accepted the argument for obtaining more details about production before carrying out a final reform.In the Great Lakes some 16 species have been affected.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that you welcome this agreement.
Mr President, a disaster on this scale calls for reactions going far beyond those of the past.She incurred the anger of the fundamentalists in Bangladesh mainly because she defended the rights of women in the context of certain Islamic traditions.
I should like to place particular emphasis on that point, because it was raised in the discussion.
As far as the general picture is concerned, I would recall that alarm has grown considerably over the past three or four years.Areas of intensive production that threatens the environment have not been affected by the agri-environmental measures.Any information we may receive - and we shall seek it - will be passed on to the honourable Members.
On the subject of procedure, we have seen irregularity after irregularity.
The Commission has not provided anything new.
In many cases the reason for non-progress is the profound divergence of opinion between the Member States.
The Andorran authorities stressed, however, that they could neither produce statistics on cigarette sales, nor could they ascertain the final destination of the goods in question.I therefore believe that any concession in the context of the World Trade Organization, which it appears that the Commission is planning, must be thoroughly examined.
The European Union should not just be an economic partner, but also a political mediator.In all these regions there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done.I believe it will also be decisive for later votes, not only for the Commission and the Council but also for Parliament.
There were, however, no guarantees that this new type of meeting would be a success.parents and their child walking with tennis rackets and balls
But I rather agree with the President-in-Office when he called for courage and vision.He does not even say 'have reached'; he says 'have exceeded'.There are also some questions from Professor Cabrol to be answered if homeopathy is to be dignified as a medical science proper.
Obliging Parliament to shuttle between Brussels and Strasbourg is a terrible waste of financial resources.
In so doing you have admittedly also imposed an obligation upon the bodies and institutions of the European Union to review their practices.
WelcomeSuch parties can only be created in theory.A country must be free to introduce higher environmental charges to demonstrate that it is possible and to show the positive effects this step can have.
I hope that the House will be able to support the report.However, I very much regret that the USA did not send representatives to the hearing or use the opportunity to comment on the material submitted.I can summarise it in a few sentences.
They managed that.
European works councils, for example, must have the power to intervene rather than simply the right to be informed.
That is why a Community policy framework for cryptography is urgently needed.So the European Parliament is preparing to vote on a 1999 budget which will only serve finally to augment its propaganda appropriations.Mr President, one of the most worthwhile projects we can pursue is providing the physical infrastructure to link the EU candidate countries with the existing Member States.
The aim of the present initiative is to create our own code of conduct for European firms.I hope that our presidency will be seen in retrospect to have developed some arguments for the long term that may contribute to the revitalization of that ideal.We then come to Article 5(1) - the source of such controversy.
We want them to begin as soon as they are ready.
They represent policy areas that are at the very heart of the European Union.The Commission has most certainly not tried to hide anything.
We now have more socialist governments than ever and they keep contacting us to say it is not a good idea.
Is it acceptable that certain posts are kept empty, sometimes for years, waiting for the appropriate cabinet member?
It was impossible to include it in the Treaty originally, so it remained outside.
Will Parliament, in that case, have to use the only means ultimately available to it, which is that we refuse to discuss the budget if no solution is found?
I should like to thank the Commission for listening.Madam President, I have listened closely to the Commission's views on the amendments, but I am afraid that the Commission's position on Amendment No 19 escaped me.
The Socialist Group advocates scrapping the reserve in the budget line for financial cooperation with Turkey.
Do not misunderstand me: this applies to the governments of all the Member States and, incidentally, of every party-political persuasion.According to a recent statement by the Council of Europe, women are the main victims of sexual exploitation using the networks, which constitutes a serious violation of human rights.I have not seen any, despite reading them all.Mr van den Broek is still detained elsewhere, but I would remind you that the Commission is a collegiate body and that Mr Monti is here with us.
It is that flexibility that has enabled him to complete this report, which deals with a highly important subject for all the Union's institutions.Is Mr Duisenberg present?
So I was delighted when UCLAF was set up at this Parliament's initiative.
(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)However, some Member States, some applicant countries and some sectors may feel the effects of the crisis more than others, for example the agricultural sector.
Mr President, by way of a point of order, I have a request to make.Without such objectives set, the framework programme will lack the necessary vision.
I recognise that substantial progress has been made, but the final goal, the ideal, is yet to be achieved.
In particular, it would seem important to highlight positive trends and future job markets.Above all, the European Union must formulate, once and for all, a policy of genuine cooperation with these Mediterranean states.
It is a top priority and I am sure that the Cardiff Summit will want to address this issue.Averroës' journey within Islam is mysterious to say the least and, in any case, does not conform to the orthodox religion of Islam.My second point is that emissions trading can only be allowed if the bulk of the effort is made at national level.We must improve the quality of management systems, supervisory systems and, in particular, financial systems, on an international basis.It is only right and proper that we should continue.
The real question here is: who has what homework to do?The Santer Commission has submitted Agenda 2000 to us.
However, the right to join a trade union and the right to engage in collective bargaining are often forgotten.I think that is the wrong way round.
An independent investigation of the reports of corruption, fraud and nepotism is essential, and the Commission's work needs to be substantially improved.Can we all remain seated in future, when you call us to speak?This Commission proposal will also contain many of the basic ideas from your amendments.
a bunch of sheep that are eating on some grass
Recovery here is probably impossible without international aid, which has not been forthcoming, mainly due to a lack of confidence.
Mr President, the Committee on Development and Cooperation is rather embarrassed about this request.A huge crowd is walking down one side of a street.
We are facing a very difficult position as I am sure you are aware yourself.
Closer involvement of the national parliaments, as already provided in the Amsterdam Treaty, should also be considered.
Incidentally, this will change in future as there will be quite different ways of accessing the Internet, not via PC but, for example, via television sets.I believe there are a few points about these reports on which we have to come to a basic understanding.
(Applause) ... they should keep quiet, because there we are a kind of living structural fund!
However, we will face environmental problems from quite the opposite end of the spectrum with the next enlargement of the Community.
We assume, of course, that we will receive it, and then we shall deal with it in accordance with Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty.I would have liked the report to enlighten me on this.
However, there are also parties in which the candidates are chosen on the basis of the preference of the leader of the party or his or her entourage.It is not enough to control the old trade routes from South America, North Africa or the Far East.I too regret, as previous speakers have, the failure of Member States to insert an energy chapter during the discussions in Amsterdam.Question No 37 by Bernd Posselt (H-1230/98) Subject: Celebrating the millenniumMay I ask that this be rectified?We must beware of being so ambitious that the project will become untenable.In other words, the report is excellent in that it contains justifiably strong criticisms concerning the current state of the CFSP.They are frequently incoherent, they are sometimes dangerous for the territorial balance of the Member States and they neglect the difficulties experienced by many European workers, particularly fishermen.The proposed decentralisation could cause problems when it comes to precisely determining which costs can be subsidised with Community funds.
We are now in danger of making the same mistake once again for 1999.I think that this report by my colleague Mr Secchi, whom we should thank for his work, should give a certain impetus and specify dates and undertakings.
The priority given to the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles in the European Union's policy on development aid must be welcomed once again.
The blasphemy law should not just be toned down, but abolished.
Thank you, Mr Flynn.A real social dialogue cannot ignore the tragic results of the policy of liberalising the markets, the policy signalled by the criteria of EMU and the stability pact.Firstly, because the democratization of European economic policy is more necessary than ever since the arrival of the third stage of monetary union.
No court, no judge, no power can take the life of a human being.
That is the real problem.I will begin with Agenda 2000.(The sitting was suspended at 11.25 a.m. and resumed at 11.40 a.m.)Every year more money and more resources are requested.
It was particularly interesting yesterday to hear what the future Member States are doing or intend to do in these areas and how we can further strengthen cooperation.
As ex-rapporteur, I can only emphasize that the democratization of the European Union is not yet complete.
a kitchen with a big sink and a rack for the pots
We all know that some of those in favoured locations are very competitive.That is the one ray of sunshine.The first is that most of these instances have already been covered by the practice of the last few years, so there is in fact no need for a modification.The report contains too many derogations, and the time-limits for improvements are too far off in the future.
We call on the Commission to explain how the objectives stipulated in the biodiversity strategy can be implemented, and we wish to be consulted by the Commission on this issue.So I will not add any further comments to what Herbert Bösch said, given his personal commitment.
Here I have to say, ladies and gentlemen, there is some misunderstanding about this proposal.
Fair enough, you can request it.
Clearly Hong Kong has to have autonomy in its own economic affairs but it also has to have the support of China.
The population expects politicians to tackle such problems and present solutions, that is, to create a system of laws or rules and undertake harmonization.
It is not about the software industry, about Microsoft versus European companies.Surely it cannot be a problem to inform Parliament beforehand what is to be discussed at Council meetings, and, afterwards, what was discussed.
I invite you to re-read my inaugural address to you in January 1995 and judge for yourselves whether I have kept my word.
My outrage at the manipulative behaviour of the tobacco industry which shows a callous disregard for ethics and public health concerns far outweighs the previous reservations that I had.
Even the European Council in Cardiff that has just ended underlined these concepts in the spirit of encouraging the active continuation of work on the matter.
Should we vote for censure?Basically they will be looking at what is the best kind of system to enable them to make more gains in the next election.
But Article 3(2) is much more interesting ...
In this context, we should not forget that there are some countries in the European Union with a 25 % tax rate.A man stares at another man tying a tie.
Another area where cities can and must play a fundamental role is in the conservation of the environment, because the most serious environmental problems are concentrated in cities.Recital 13 is a poor apology for what the Parliament proposed and the Commission's statement on the matter is only a sticking-plaster on the wound.
That, I am afraid, is exactly what is happening in Gaza.It is nonsense.We want to make this rather less complicated than it is in the Commission proposal.We believe that fiscal policy is a key issue at this point if immediate progress is to be made in completing the single market.It is the best poverty index so let us use it.Mr President, you cannot open a newspaper anywhere in Europe without being confronted with the dramatic issue of asylum-seekers and the major differences of opinion of governments on this.(Parliament approved the request)
We consider that these new terms are likely to ensure a more effective implementation of the agreement in line with the basic principles of the conservation of resources.
On that occasion, Parliament suggested that Article 7 of the Directive already offered an adequate opportunity.
We can also envisage various forms of reinforcement, within the framework of the UN Charter, of the UN's and OSCE's roles in this connection.
Only in this way can we monitor the flow of funds from the Commission to final beneficiaries.
What is lacking is a confidence-building, recognisable system, an approach clearly based on a system.The more flexible approach and the general objectives are considered on the whole to represent substantial progress.
In Ireland, in 1991, there were 429 ecstasy tablets seized compared to 17 516 tablets in 1997.
We have thus redrafted a number of amendments, most importantly concerning second-hand goods.
There have been signs that the government intends to pay employees in the industries concerned the salaries that have remained outstanding.We have battled against irregularities, we have stepped up our efforts against fraud.They must not seek salvation in the short-term solution of protectionist measures against trade and the movement of capital - quite the contrary.
Why do we need planning?That is the decisive factor and in this respect the proper start has been made.
With Agenda 2000, a fundamental reform is necessary to improve food safety, particularly in meats.
I think we have reached some important agreements on principles; now there are a few points to be finalised.The fifth priority concerns the question of refugees and asylum seekers.It is a matter of setting priorities: greater rights for the holder, or the freedoms of the Internet user and the right of the Internet service provider to operate.Where should these troops withdraw to?At first, the Council was dilatory in dealing with this important bill, the Luxembourg Presidency passing it on to the British Presidency.
And this will only be achieved through transparent and adequate funding.In the context of the Socialists' amendment we discussed whether there should be a reduction.We are in no way opposed to legal adoptions.
Mr President, China, an immutable yet changing country, has once again recently given us an example of its contradictions and its difficulties.We often talk for instance about the need for institutional reforms.The changes in the global economy have to be taken seriously, and we should not be making it difficult for farmers to cope in the face of major challenges.
And does the report mention any of this?We should not put the cart before the horse, and we must not give up before we begin.Then again, there is the Committee on the Environment.
The disciplines agreed do not include a ban on investment in expropriated property, and investments already made remain completely unaffected.
Not even radiation can do that.And the same obviously goes for the future members of the Union.
We are dealing here with a phenomenon which is already significant and is increasing constantly: 10 % of families with children are in this situation.
I also agree that there is no reason to maintain the ban on registering veterinary homeopathic medicinal products for foodproducing animals.But we are all aware of the fragility of democracy itself and that the most elaborate structures which aim to respect the rights and duties of everyone are the weakest.
It is widely accepted that this subject must not and cannot be renationalisation but, as stated in Cardiff, that we must focus on the future of Europe.We in this Parliament must respect the dividing-line between private issues and public and political matters.
It means that the government must act to protect the victims of the conflict, including more than a million refugees, many of whom are blacks and Indios.
Commissioner Bjerregaard will be describing to you in more detail what contribution the Commission will be making in future.Very little.
I agree with him on most points and support his proposal, although there is one area where he is being over-ambitious in my view.This is one of the reasons why we are calling for an additional initiative in the area of the information society.Question No 49 by Maj Theorin (H-0747/98)
At the Cardiff Summit the Union imposed a deadline on itself.
I have made a point of asking the Commission in written questions to do that.That is the crucial problem.
Let me tell you that the steel industry as well as the entire precision-engineering and light-engineering industries cannot do anything at all with contaminated steel. That is another constraint.
I cannot comment on the substance of the claims, but I believe they are serious enough for us to look into them very thoroughly.Food products resulting from new research must only enter the food chain after the most stringent tests have been undertaken.(The order of business was adopted)That is all I have to say, Madam President.
My criticism was a political one, it was not aimed at the formalities and the Rules of Procedure!Progress has been modest so far, however.Mr Schwaiger, you can request that the subject be included in the topical and urgent debate.Nevertheless, action is needed on the problems I have touched upon and we need answers.Over the period 1994/95 only 378 documents were requested, of which the applicants were granted access to 222.Contrary to last year, however, there may well be spending requirements if current developments on some markets are confirmed.
The competition in the USA and Japan never sleeps.
We cannot simply proceed as normal, because making the wrong decision in such a sensitive area as this would further undermine confidence in the European Union.Intellectual property is not theft.
This is not sustainable and should be changed.Similarly, the recommendations proposed by the Commission, with regard to the euro area as a whole, coincide with the arrival of the euro and represent quite a novelty.I do not understand what has happened.After today's vote it is clear that a proportional electoral system will apply to the whole of the Union in future.
As regards the advisory nature of the guidelines, I want to reiterate that it was always intended that the guidelines should provide a general framework only.A strong employment policy in Europe clearly has an economic perspective which goes beyond the employment guidelines.In conclusion, the French Government is a sovereign government.
With the introduction of the euro just three weeks away, the Union is beset by indecision.Fatos Nano is not observing the principles of the rule of law.Both are high-quality products.Parliament and the Council are of course working on the final phase of adoption, but in the preliminary stages, the Commission and all the services were very heavily involved.Please, let us vote on it now.Therefore, the case for granting Objective 1 status to the midland region for the period 2000 to 2006 is both real and compelling and beyond reproach.Proposals on quality indications or certificates of special qualities of products with the exception of traditional specialities were, however, rejected.During your speech I will refer to it myself.Employee share ownership in the US is exploring new forms of worker participation in firms and is opening up share ownership to a new public.One very important question has been completely ignored by the Commission, which is the situation young farmers find themselves in, and their future prospects.
In this context it is very important to support the process, already underway, of companies operating in third countries setting up their own voluntary codes of conduct.While none can ever be certain, it is my strong personal conviction that the Commission turned a possible triumph into a certain defeat by that ill-timed intervention.However, I would venture to say that we are only at the beginning of a very complex transformation process.It therefore usefully supplements the present legislation.There is going to be an increase in funding compared to the fourth framework programme, in fact a considerable increase of 42 %.Common system of VAT - Products subject to excise duty
I hope that the dialogue will have a positive outcome, and I believe the European Parliament has every intention of asserting its position.This involves firstly the economic dimension.I hope that the Austrian Presidency will display more tact than the British President-in-Office, Mr Cook.
Also, the European Union's objective should be to lower VAT, not to harmonize it. This is vital for social justice.I have good news for Mrs Ewing on the matter of minority languages and she can have some warm words for the Commission.At the end of 1997, we were informed that significant quantities of British-manufactured cigarettes were being exported to Andorra.With the ECB, money appears to be getting further and further away from democratic systems of decision-making, circulating as it is in electronic form and in worldwide networks.A person walks by several red ties hanging and a pair of red shoes on the floor.
An efficient system of police cooperation is required, and I am pleased to see that Europol has now had its mandate broadened accordingly.This is something which looks set to bring everything grinding to a halt in the very near future.
This objective groups together four separate and distinct actions, namely one for urban areas, one for industrial areas, one for rural and mountain areas and one for fisheries.
At the meeting of the Council held on 3 and 4 December, agreement was reached on the future composition of the management board.This annual report does not provide an adequate point of reference or explanation as to the type of policy to be managed.What does more efficient policy-making mean?
We would perhaps be better advised to put as much energy into actually achieving far-reaching reforms as into preaching about them.But I will also be quite honest with you: subsidiarity cannot be used to undermine the European cause itself.
I wonder whether the Union could not in some way divide the salmon fishing fairly between Sweden and Finland. The issue concerns both of these countries.
The Tindemans report therefore points the way to European independence in the narrower sense of defence policy.
As everybody knows it received massive backing by all the people on the island of Ireland only last week.Mr President, I appreciate and thank you for your kind words.
Mr Bangemann did not mention the Echelon system in his speech and did not even say he intended to speak about it later.That is a very good thing, as the Muslim communities can involve their imams who have a role to play in our own social and cultural life.NATO and the EU were set up to prevent a repetition of those events.This means young people are exposed to extreme danger, and are therefore guinea-pigs for unscrupulous businessmen.
My group cannot support this strict linkage.
We are prepared to help it to reach this goal.We can already see the unreasonable effects of the Dublin Convention when the principle of the first asylum country is applied to countries which have different criteria for granting asylum.
Do we want to keep the European farming model or apply with quasi-inquisitorial rigour the notion of pure European breeds?
Perhaps, to take up a point that was touched upon today by our State Secretary, we should also adopt a more resolute approach on the international stage.
The Commission has no information that would allow it to make a comparative assessment of quality problems in the individual Member States.The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:Looking at the situation as it is at present, the incorporation of environmental safeguards into other policy areas is still nowhere near good enough.
Madam President, we have all been surprised to see that Hong Kong has remained one of the most free and open markets in the world since the UK handover.
I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath.
I would also like to emphasise that in the request for a split vote it only states that we should vote in three sections.
I welcome the content of the motion for a resolution now before us and we also regard this as important support for our work in this field.They understand that together we are more capable of fighting large-scale crime, organised international fraud, and trafficking of every kind.Five hundred thousand women are victims of the present-day slave trade which is called trafficking in women.Or is it being muzzled intentionally?
The report formulates an information policy for the EU.
That is why I am in favour of changing the whole concept to 'safer use of the Internet' .
Through his work and findings, the Ombudsman has also obliged the Council and the Commission to justify more precisely why the institutions have not surrendered documentation to the public.
It fosters a culture of ingenuity and solidarity, whilst at the same time it nurtures the soil in which all manner of shady deals find sustenance.
Finally, as far as combating exclusion is concerned, the Council believes that the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will make it possible for the necessary legal bases to be adopted.Registration documents for motor vehiclesWe should also like to see the partners, when they so wish, involve the CEMR in the negotiations on the social dialogue, but only on their own initiative.Obviously the approach should be to achieve a more equitable solution but that requires a north/south balance and also progressivity in the budgetary contributions from all Member States.
This very matter is, moreover, dealt with in Mr Bösch's report, which we shall be discussing tomorrow.What does the European idea mean?
We have been working together for six months, and I hope we can do so again in the future.This resolution goes in the right direction.And as for the specific proposal about the president, we stress our full respect for his independence, including the mandate for which he has been proposed.We therefore think that a transparent arrangement is needed which is based on reimbursement of the actual costs incurred and which precludes the possibility of abuse.The present report on the Action Plan 'Transatlantic Economic Partnership' expressly supports the initiative of the Commission and the Council.Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if the European Union was as it should be, we would not be here today debating the Customs Union with Turkey.
Another aspect which requires serious thought is the question of the debt recovery procedures in Article 5.This is a crude and indiscriminate instrument.I could fill in the desk and chair and take everything else.This is absurd.
Three years ago UCLAF's staff were scattered throughout the Commission. Today the whole operation is under one roof.
Would the colleagues around Mrs Mann please take their seats.What are the important points then?
We are talking about the first step in the process and, in the light of this, we shall have to decide on the subsequent activities.I repeat: the issues are also the cultural identity of linguistic areas and cultural diversity in Europe.
It seems odd to talk of freedom when, according to the agenda, the first item for discussion should have been the question of the Echelon system.Since it was mentioned by my colleague, Mr Evans, what progress has been made on the introduction of a health card?I do not believe the advantages of having a common label would go any distance towards offsetting these risks.
The EU plays a vital economic and financial role in the Middle East which is likely to grow in importance.So we need to find and create that margin for interpretation, as Mr Corbett said, and as I understand it, that is also the rapporteur's intention.The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.
This is why our committee has proposed a model for the future that, while maintaining the traditional distinction between infrastructure and content, aims to simplify the regulatory framework.
So if the majority of this Parliament does not vote in favour of our amendment on pluralism, I will, regrettably, vote against this report.
Schengen also has to be compatible with the intergovernmental Nordic Passport Union, so that freedom of movement in Scandinavia can continue and develop as it has done for 40 years.The Connecticut Yankee was a telephone engineer in America who sustained a blow to his head and was transported back to the time of King Arthur.In particular, what powers have been accorded to the Commission to demand that states take the "necessary and proportionate measures' to remove such obstacles to trade?Despite the good intentions of the Commissioner, I have a general problem with this proposal, and my group agrees.
The first attempt has already borne fruit.
Those who are familiar with the situation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds will know that Mr Hänsch hit the nail on the head.
The Commission is currently developing two new anti-corruption actions.
In particular I want to deplore the role of the British Government in this.
A motorcycle parked on a stone cobble road, in the sun.
No party will win an election if it puts this at the centre of its campaign.And, sometimes, of institutions.Is that the great problem about whose solution the German and other governments are agonising?That, then, is the economic scale of a sector which is progressing, growing, increasing, and to which Europe's institutions still seem not to give proper consideration.
I am aware of the reactions provoked by this judgment in a limited number of countries, and particularly in Sweden.
I am sorry, but no agreement can override the Rules of Procedure.
In the final analysis, consumers are calling for greater certainty and more guarantees, and these are precisely the issues addressed in the document under discussion today.The Commission, while allowing this to happen, adopts an entirely different attitude to the pig producers of Northern Ireland.
A bathroom with a sink and other items. 
And, once again, the situation will not be accidental.
I would like to address four tasks.
Mr President, firstly may I welcome Mrs Bjerregaard back to the Chamber.Finland and Sweden, in their negotiations on joining the EU, received a special dispensation in respect of banning certain antibiotics in animal food.
It is outrageous to hear a European Commissioner state, here before the House, that the market will decide whether a product is good or bad.
This has cost the European budget a great deal of money over the past few years, on account of BSE, and swine fever, in particular.Similarly, the Committee accepts Amendment No 2 which lends support to the aim of maintaining a balance between the root vegetable starch and cereal starch sectors.
Parliament has no equivalent right.
My concern now is that we must know the facts ahead of any action that the Commission and the Council might take in abandoning the tax-free policy.In this way, the arrangement provides a more transparent basis for cooperation restricted to products the public can easily identify and it also respects the channel's independence.
Mr President, how are countries to cope with an economic crisis once we have the euro?This agreement is decidedly insufficient, and must therefore be rejected.Mr President, I share the view that the Titley report is an important one, and it comes at a significant time.
Mr Santer reacted firmly when he should not have done, but he was not firm when he should have been.
European agriculture must be competitive in two ways.
Contrary to what the rapporteur said and wrote in his report, I think that such a request is absurd and, what is more, is extremely detrimental to the fishermen concerned.An extreme ecologist position, unreasonable in economic terms, has thus been avoided.We should have been given the chance at least to put arguments in favour of the proposal before it was rejected.I put the question because the main reason why Sweden decided not to join EMU was that public opinion was against it.
He may have got as far as Brussels and is probably now trying to come cross-country with huskies.It is important for us to say that because this whole budget of the European Union is so small, it makes little difference.Amongst other things, we established that the Commission had used more than 50 % of the staff posts earmarked for the programme in other areas of expenditure.
These are the excuses that are given all too often for extreme incidents.
It is not enough to say these things, welcome though the words are.
The problem we have in Turkey is not actually a problem we have in Europe.I am confident we can find agreement between the institutions.I would also congratulate my own colleague, Willy De Clercq for his role in chairing that.On a subject as sensitive as drugs abuse, where very different points of view exist, not everybody could have their way.This interpretation does not, however, cover the issue of gender-related persecution or sexual abuse - which is a great pity.The powers of the Council must also increase.
In Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs there was widespread support for this proposal.This has been proven by Hurricane Mitch, which has ravaged Central America and brought the international community to life.
All the candidates consider that the price stability objective has more or less been achieved in Europe, which should help, in the future, to keep interest rates low.These results, which will no doubt be discussed in Vienna, are as follows.
some snow skiers are going up a hill
One hundred per cent of resources come from the Member States.Nobody would be able to understand that.
I therefore feel that it would be profoundly regrettable if this were to be the signal that this elected Chamber sends out to its voters.
The reason for its creation was that the Court of Justice itself could no longer cope with its case load.Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate Mrs Mann on the preparation and presentation of a very fine report.This legal instrument is not only important as a means of taking matters further forward, but also in that it highlights the importance of the European Court of Justice.
Our frontier workers will also benefit from this, although no such insurance exists either in Belgium or in France.It is our task to give them the support they need in order to develop and grow from small firms into medium-sized and then to large firms.
It was never the intention that major decisions which have absorbed the European press in recent days would be concluded at Vienna.
We should not be surprised; he does after all come from Bavaria, and all sorts of good things come from Bavaria.You have made a number of proposals that I agree with.Question No 45 by Philippe De Coene (H-0642/98)
Thank you very much, Commissioner Pinheiro.Energy prices continue to be too low.(Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)
I have spoken out against parts of the report because it skirts around this very real problem.Thank you, Mrs Günther.We each have our own role to play.It is therefore not unusual for us to be discussing coffee at this time.Big farms and holdings in well-to-do agricultural regions receive large amounts of aid, while small ones in peripheral and sparsely populated areas receive very little.
The discharge vote will be the appropriate time for assessing the ECHO scandal.
Mr President, I do not belong to the group of colleagues here who are congratulating Mr Tindemans.
Top priority must be given to health, education and housing, as well as far-reaching agricultural reform.
You are still referring to the necessary legal basis for the payment of loans in the budget of the European Union.Happily, the new Federal Government has decided to proceed with the longoverdue removal of these hazards.If the peace talks are to go smoothly, the European Parliament should not interfere.There are five different interpretations, but I believe we will find a compromise there.For a few moments at least, this will be an opportunity for me to return to a former role I had several years ago as Commissioner for energy.
On the matter itself, however, we entirely agree with him.
More efforts should be made by the Commission to find new markets for arable products.
Firstly, balance must be restored between tax deductions on salaries and those on the holders of capital.
That issue is violence on television, and I am surprised that this serious problem has not been dealt with in the report.
It is also due to the disappearance of Latin America's Asian markets, through no fault of its own.Our opportunities for export in these areas have shrunk dramatically.It is an inflexible market, in which an increase in production and the resulting price drop do not lead to greater consumption.
My preference would be ECU 1 million, as we could easily accept that and arrange everything quite successfully.As a nation of tea drinkers, the British would rather like to know why it is that sucrose esters are not approved of by the Commission.
I am very grateful to the honourable Member for his question and the way in which he phrases it.They will give Parliament in particular an opportunity to clarify its positions on Agenda 2000, which it is debating today and will vote on tomorrow.
According to available figures, malicious telephone calls are on the increase across Europe.
Today, he celebrates 86 wonderful and fruitful years.I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Approval of the Minutes
We voted against the proposal because it will not solve the issue of the tobacco growers' dependence on extensive EU subsidies in either the short or the long term.Let us think back: the Luxembourg summit instructed the Vienna summit to adopt an employment pact.
We cannot, you cannot, raise the question of confidence today.We can, of course, regret the time that has been taken over such an important issue.
The strategy which the Commission proposes goes in another direction.No WTO member has the right unilaterally to judge the compliance of another, nor to be judge and jury in its own cause.That concludes Question Time.
Thank you very much, Mr Fischler, for your presence and your replies.How misguided we are!
Finally, I would like to mention the amendment that I have moved with Mrs Jackson and a number of other Members right across the spectrum of Parliament.
I know it is by her choice and of course all politicians prefer to make departures only by choice and not because of the will of the electorate.
Their students too must be able to experience their future in Europe.
We need to draw up extensive programmes to return these people to their countries, and the European states would participate in these on a voluntary basis.
The rapporteur has quite correctly addressed some of the deficiencies of the common position and the Socialist Group will certainly support the amendments he has tabled.Cooperation between our two institutions was exemplary during the negotiations.Recital G begins: ' Inquiet du non respect par Israël des engagements... '
For the rest, they also help to prepare young people for the mobility needed on a larger European job market.
Apart from this, Parliament guarantees the Ombudsman its cooperation, whether through access to documents, through giving information or through the Petitions Committee, guaranteeing that requests for information are followed up.
This resolution goes in the right direction.
The conversion rate between currencies in the euro zone has been fixed irrevocably, thus preventing the use of 'spread', which means different buying and selling rates.
The negotiations to that end must be conducted as rapidly as possible, so that the ten nations of central Europe can share the European Union's common values.Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, 1999 will be a decisive year for the future of European agriculture.
We are putting the whole issue at risk.The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.I shall discuss in more detail the reasons for highlighting these three countries in a moment.The EU should pursue consumer policy in such a way that it is actually feasible, for smaller consumers' organisations too, to take part in projects.
Then we can look forward to some extremely useful work on a subject of growing public concern.The issue of fair compensation, and I speak for the British Labour members, poses a problem for the United Kingdom.However, this is precisely the case today.Moreover, we must - as we have said before - ensure that we do not just get more hot air into the system through having unambitious objectives.
a close up of a dog in a car window
I will quote only one: for example, the company "Alfa Cie.I should now like to say a few words on the impact of recent events in Brazil on European industry.
This is too contradictory.Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Anastassopoulos report, as voted for this morning, does Parliament no credit.
This is the eighth annual report on Structural Fund spending.On the question of fission energy, our position is that we wish to see a phasing-out of nuclear power, although any decisions must be taken at national level.
I hope that you will listen to the industry.The administrative procedures governing EU intervention need simplifying, for example.
So we should welcome this desire to coordinate and bring some order into the situation, because the action plan is undeniably a step forward.Mr President, first I would like to thank the draftsman of the report for some very painstaking work.
My group deplores the fact that the Council has given a negotiating mandate to the Commission and already adopted an action plan without waiting to hear the European Parliament's position.
It is also an expression of great clear-sightedness and very thorough economic analysis which deserves praise.The Council's interpretation, which is just to gamble on the levels of under-spending, particularly on internal policies, is unacceptable.
At the very least, the right to invoke freedom of movement in national courts should be upheld, as called for by the rapporteur.The fact that consumers will benefit from lower food prices will more than compensate for any initially increased budget costs.I can assure Members of this House that the correct formalities were observed.The political climate is certainly far from being stabilised.I can see no justification for Latvia having inferior status in comparison with some other applicant countries when it comes to EU membership.
We have followed the inspired 'Monnet method' in the European Union for more than 40 years: a step-by-step approach towards further integration with no blueprint of the ultimate goal.
What we are dealing with here is a new CAP reform, an overhaul of the 1992 reform.But ignoring the problem is no help either.
That will be music to the ears of many farmers in the European Union.
ApplauseThe Kyoto agreement as it is obliges us to find solutions.
For almost 15 years Du Pont de Nemours has used CFC-11 as a solvent to produce a polyurethane fleece.The government is responsible for extending and strengthening the rule of law and for protecting those who are fighting for dignity and democratic principles.
In that regard I would ask the Commissioner to examine seriously whether or not Sellafield-THORP would come into that particular category.The amendments proposed by Mr Barón Crespo are in line with this and I fully support them.I believe that a combination of these strategies can lead to a significant reduction in the wasteful discarding of good-quality edible fish.
Were it not for the fact that the term 'historic' has been overused on many occasions, no doubt we would be able to use it in this instance too.It is a Community project.
In 1997, I duly tabled a proposal for the introduction of common rules to govern immigration into the EU.Your comments will be given consideration.
My Danish colleague from the movement of permanent discontent evidently had some difficulty with that.
But we do not wish on countries experiencing high levels of unemployment a solution that only weakens citizenship and undermines the European social model.Having listened to the hearing and done some considerable work myself I find the dangers of experiments with polar electromagnetism to be potentially very damaging and possibly calamitous.In fact, their importance is such that they are self-evident.The second major amendment which the Commission has difficulty with is Amendment No 20.
I think that the cornerstone might be to ensure compliance with codes of good agricultural practice.Let us hope then that the European Parliament's position will help to achieve the necessary goal of raising the public's awareness in this respect.
The will to combat paramilitary activities is crucial in order to make progress.
And now the latest neurotic obsession is seeing CO2 and greenhouse gases everywhere.
Agricultural subsidies in Sweden must be shared equitably between north and south.
The Director of Personnel is a prisoner.
When border controls were abolished through the single market the Member States could no longer carry out border controls as before on the border itself.The federal government has set itself the goal of adopting Agenda 2000 in its entirety as early as this spring.
We have a duty to respond to their plight.The scope of the directive is not being significantly altered and it does not impact directly on the functioning of the single market.A very small bathroom with a commode a stand up shower, and sink.
Please allow me to declare an interest.A red and white bus parked in front of a small church.
What are the consequences for long-term food security and quality, not to mention the role of farmers as managers of the environment?
Were the price were to drop below face value, people would be encouraged to buy gold and make their own coins.This would mean accepting that taxation at source will only apply to small savers' deposits.Mr President, the submission deadline was 9.00 p.m.a white cat is laying down on the ground
In effect, the European Parliament has done what the Council was loath to do.
If he will do so we can deal with this report in two minutes.Such shocks exist in our Member States.
It will be a new reference currency of great economic potency, and I very much hope the euro will help to turn that into great political potency.A reduction in taxation relieving the obligatory burden on employment taxes and transferring these at least in part to eco-taxes would help to promote such a development.To be quite frank, this aspect of the matter was simply suppressed.We had the decision from Maastricht, with much still needing to be resolved institutionally, and we tried to come to an agreement in the Committee.
The implementation of rights associated with European citizenship has accomplished much, though there is still room for improvement.We are clear on this and always have been.I can fully endorse its contents.
That is why my group, as we have already said, supports the Spanish and UK authorities for taking this courageous step.
Each of our institutions has a very substantial role to play in accomplishing this great reform project.We must not portray an image of the European Council meeting to discuss matters that are only of concern to top politicians.Finally, HCFCs still have a very high ODP and a high global-warming potential.
The Commission has the job of making this objective achievable in the next seven years.We shall wait and hear what conclusions it reaches.
We have actually talked enough about all these principles.This is certainly very complicated, but once it is implemented we will see how we can achieve even better results.
It is not merely annoying that as long as several years can elapse before some petitions can be resolved. It also gives a very negative picture of Europe.
The debate is closed.Any member of the committee can consult these minutes and find out the result.
I would agree with Mrs Pollack that simply to include the urban dimension in Objective 1 and 2 programmes is not sufficient.
The debate is closed.This report is therefore a step in the wrong direction.When operating in a single market under very different circumstances the worst-off producer regions must be supported by means of a common agricultural policy.
This is absolutely essential, and Europe's commitment on this point remains unshaken.
The European Union is extremely wrong in subsidizing something which shortens the lives of its users.On close study of this central theme, the possible consequences become apparent immediately.
This will be replaced with the simpler system under which companies can use their regular VAT returns to deduct VAT incurred in another Member State.In its name, Europe has seen it lead to both deflation and inflation at the same time: deflation in the labour market, and inflation in the capital market.
Help us out of our plight, and afterwards I will shake your hand again, because having the name Funke is not such a bad thing after all, is it?The report is correct when it says that we must tackle this problem.Looking at the Elles report, it would seem that this harsh lesson has taught the Commission nothing.Turkey is not a member of the European Union.
To establish that there is an objection, at least 12 Members must rise.
But I believe there is a much more humane alternative to fortress Europe which is at present on the European drawing board.At the same time our farmers' interests must be protected.We cannot say that they are welcoming each other with open arms.
Steps must be taken to ensure that efficiency cannot be undermined by illegal subsidies, but the relevant facts must be on the table.That concludes Question Time.I will not enter into any commitment at this stage.Furthermore, the different controls in the Member states are often the source of legal uncertainty and of inadequate protection.Mochovce is certain to attract our attention, and Bohunice is a permanent source of concern and worry for the public.
Many National Action Plans do not fix any concrete aims or financial resources, or else they are inadequate.
Four years ago there was the Lusaka protocol, an agreement that we saw as the basis for many years of peace.
Traditionally, we get this debate underway with an oral question and a motion for a resolution.In simple terms, it is clear that when exchange rates were involved, shocks were possible within the Member States which had consequences for the whole Union.We want a simpler and more certain tax-based definition than that proposed by the Commission.
I repeat: we do not need an information campaign for the euro.European parliamentary office is an important office.On paragraph 21
I can endorse very much of what the previous speaker said.
That means that we are left with the basic problem of a worrying lack of consensus about the direction of European integration.
Constructive and voluntary cooperation between Member States and the chemical industry is especially welcome.
In fact this directive is much more - if we take a serious look at it.This is a report taken without debate so it should be Rule 97 which is a matter of urgency requested by the Council.It is going to be difficulty to rein back this particular sector of the industry; in Denmark it is an important industrial sector.However, there is at least one area mentioned in the rapporteur's excellent report in which I do not wish to see interinstitutional agreements increasing the influence of the European Parliament.
Legislation varies from country to country, and any harmonisation must be based on the highest possible safety standards.Parliament's Bureau could have approved this decision long ago, since it had the authority to do so.A point she made very clear in her statement, which I would endorse, was that we cannot lose ground.Mr President, the Council has always shown a special interest in matters in connection with maintaining a healthy population structure in rural areas.
Time off work for family reasons and part-time work must also be options for men, those who are highly trained and those who are highly valued.Certification schemes are being developed all the time by Member States, and that is why we need an umbrella scheme at EU level to cover the individual systems.
We do not wish to quarrel with the list as decided up to 2004, despite the fact that here too the procedures were rather problematic.Expenditure can be accepted until the end of 2001 so there is some time left to cater for the expenditure.
It destabilizes the fragile political order in Albania and increases the risk of dangerous interventions in the Kosovo crisis - and let us not forget that.
Competitive ways must be found of producing fuels which will spare the environment and reduce consumption.That means that 80 % of expenditure is also spent by the Member States.I sincerely hope the Council will approve what we proposed which is a significant step forward as regards the European proposal.Farmers need help now to get through to Christmas.
In my view, to enter into that kind of doctrinal dispute would be more likely to be damaging for homeopathic medicinal products.
Now she thinks that the change of name will also lead to a change of substance.
He had all the information and for understandable reasons he kept it to himself.
And, if not, could it make one at the next part-session at the beginning of July in Brussels?
You do not build a house on foundations that have not been consolidated.Finally, I also support the request for a gold 100 euro coin.
We are not altogether happy about the proposal being brought before Parliament for consultation at such a late stage.
We do indeed need to have common principles in the electoral procedure for elections to this House.He does not even say 'have reached'; he says 'have exceeded'.
In view of this week's events, it will come as no surprise that we want that scrutiny to be greatly improved.Firstly, the candidates are obviously guilty who entered the competition fraudulently.The Commission appears content with the European social policy forums held every other year, although these are far from adequate.It is unrealistic to imagine that ACP producers will be able to do without pesticides altogether.There is certainly no doubt about that.
As she says, later on when we come to renegotiate all these things her point of view will be very much taken into account.
The figures for Austria alone, which I believe are similar to the European average, confirm the need for action.But I hope more than that: that we can take on the arguments that we have developed during these past few months with confidence for the future.
C4-0374/98.The Council would become a second Chamber representing the Member States and their bodies.
It is therefore high time that we completely reviewed the mistaken approach which we have taken up to now.
It is now high time that the emphasis was shifted onto entrepreneurial independence, and we MEPs could play a highly constructive role here.Why are there such delays?The situation today is that we are publicly assessing what has and has not been achieved in the National Action Plans.Farmers in my country are already suffering a huge decline in income.
Furthermore, the armed forces should comply with specific environmental rules and make good past damage to the environment caused by their own actions.
WelcomeIt has snowed this week and I am a great believer in folklore.
Then they argued that we would never find agreement amongst ourselves on a draft statute.Fassa report (A4-0198/98)Agricultural policy must make its contribution to enabling efficient farms to stand up to competition.Last year there was a preliminary discussion of a Commission proposal for an agreement governing the admission of third-country nationals to the territory of Member States.
I therefore believe that it is only natural for us to make minimum demands, for example that practices of this kind should be stopped.This is a clear violation of the Lusaka Agreements, and now it looks and sounds as though the country is preparing for war.You have said a great deal about the situation in the Netherlands.
If none are forthcoming, we shall have no option but to support the censure motion.It must be pointed out to the Austrian presidency that there is concern over a possible acceptance of low environmental standards in the candidate countries.Do we not also have a responsibility to the many excellent staff at the Commission?The Rules are very clear.It also agrees that UNITA bears the main responsibility for the resumption of fighting and that it obtains funds through illegal trade in diamonds.
This despite the fact that Article 109c of the Treaty only requires Parliament to be informed of the Council's decisions.At the beginning there were some misunderstandings because the Americans believed that we wanted to create a type of new international authority with strict regularization.A framework agreement would have had the advantage for the European Parliament of allowing it to be formally consulted.
Some will doubtless regret not having been able to retain flexible exchange rates to be able to bring their economies smoothly into line with those of their neighbours.
I believe that an inspectorate operating in a vacuum, as Mr Bösch called it, can indeed be successful if it is endowed with a sufficient number of first-class personnel.Secondly, the humanitarian situation must be improved rapidly and radically.
This is how things stand at the moment.
Like the rapporteur, the Commission attaches great importance to the socio-economic aspects of research, especially to the contribution made by such work to the definition and implementation of public policy.Mr President, once again I must raise the troublesome question I asked two months ago about when we are going to be moving into the IPE IV building.
This is a very difficult subject technically speaking, and its political sensitivity is an aggravating factor.There is no shortage of examples.
The House is holding a joint debate, and I should like to hear two statements from you.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we all agree on the objectives we are trying to achieve as regards acidification.
However, precisely because that is the case, because this openness was necessary, I should now like to draw attention to and underline what Mr De Giovanni has already said.I should therefore like to ask you to ensure that both the people of these countries, and their governments, who also do not know enough, are informed.
These sorts of misunderstandings are, of course, extremely slipshod.We should have a set of measures planned that will enable us to deal with a situation that will otherwise overwhelm us.If there was a counter-proposal which on its own merit meant that it qualified for public money, then it would qualify.I know that the rapporteur is very much concerned about transnational candidate lists as a symbol for the unity of Europe.

A man taking a selfie with a bow-tie in a car.
That is the first point.American domination and the Americans' lack of respect for the rules cannot continue.
Mr President, obviously the Commission is also extremely concerned at the recent events in Albania.
Yet the Council, in its common position, only accepted half and removed all the most important and progressive elements, particularly those relating to flight bans.So what can we do?So we are going to be consistent and apply the same criteria to all COMs.If this additional requirement is fulfilled, we can think further ahead.
It is necessary to have rules governing such action, and that was why I used the phrase 'no trading without tracking'.That is why I have been critical of the air strikes, which are a futile gesture.
It is only right and proper that we should continue.I recognise that we are making only slow progress, but we are following the right philosophy.
We do have liability rules for providers of certification services.
For all these fundamental reasons, and on the grounds of competence, the ELDR Group will abstain.
Our group is aware of the potential of organic livestock production for the agriculture of Member States.
The European Commission considers domestic services to be an area in which a high number of jobs could be created.
Chad:(The sitting was closed at 11.15 a.m.)Basically, it says that the monetary strategy to be pursued boils down to the choice between direct inflation targeting or money supply targeting as an intermediate target.
Despite the fact that new oil reserves are still being discovered, word should have got around by now that this substance is finite.
I believe the report covers all the fundamental problems in this sector.One area where we need to move forward is the link between the Council and the Parliament.
I also believe we will have to carefully assess and consider the Spanish situation.Will it be running during this Commission's ten years and, if so, by when?
The EU was there to condemn the civil war; now we must be in Guatemala to promote and maintain peace.
Mr President, the argument given by our rapporteur is unquestionable in terms of Amendment No 1.Progress is in fact being made.I think reducing the immediate funding for the MEDA programmes despite the high level of implementation is a negative political signal.
Objective 2 relates to the conversion of industrial areas, and the word 'conversion' is maintained in Agenda 2000.
Isolating Turkey would do nothing to improve the living conditions of its people or the human rights situation.In some countries stimulation policies were initiated, whereas others aimed for stabilisation.
The peace process is important and needs proper resources.My suggestion for a cut in the budget does not include the JET facility.
There are a terrible number of complaints, especially from citizens of the Union who, in one way or another, have found themselves in difficult situations.First of all, I too agree that tourism-related action must include employment, training and education.
We have made more reforms in four years than in the 40 years before that.
A washroom with a toilet and a bucket is there.
You have said a great deal about the situation in the Netherlands.Question No 31 by Pedro Aparicio Sánchez (H-0896/98)
So that assertion is not true either.
Question Time (Council)The Agriculture Committee also thinks that in future too, farmers must be able to get their prices from the market as far as possible.
First of all, I too agree that tourism-related action must include employment, training and education.The example of Chile has shown this.
The new procotol to the agreement opens up fishing in Madagascar's exclusive zone to Portuguese and Italian tuna boats for the very first time.
This is apparent in the amendments relating to the more reliable measurement and comparison of vessels' engine power and tonnage and to harmonising penalties and inspection procedures.
The Community's current programmes in the fields of general vocational training and youth policy are set to come to an end in 1999 after a period of five years.
I demand that the Greens withdraw their accusation that I am against change.I am thinking of the first Mexican debt crisis, the second Latin American debt crisis and other liquidity crises in the past decades.The communication does not contain this information.On the other hand, at present, Spanish vessels rarely fish in the Baltic.It is important to try to find a solution within the budgetary authority and to arrive at a definition of non-significant actions.Mrs d'Ancona's first report was consistent with this approach, but it was too much for some in this House, who preferred to hide behind the walls of their conviction.
A man taking a swing at a tennis ball
We have identified excess capacity in fishing fleets as the greatest obstacle to proper management of our waters.Those we can accept in their entirety are Nos 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 16 and 31.The reports of nepotism do not strengthen confidence in the Commission in any way.But what might one actually say about them?Whatever else happens, we must at least be prepared to agree to make this effort.
It will not be perfect, but striving for perfection is a good way of achieving nothing at all.
I acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in the way it affects those who are directly involved.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, those are my thoughts.
One vote will suffice.Many of us, both in the Green Group and in Parliament as a whole, are extremely upset about events surrounding the implementation of the MED programmes.They, in turn, are pressured by their employers - the companies - to sell alcohol to make money.
There will be extensive publication of policies and of the considerations underlying policies and decisions.(FABISA) in Burgos (Spain)
Fortunately, the industry itself takes occasional steps in the direction of cooperation, mergers or expansions.
A train passing by a field with a grounded airplane
The EU countries currently have very different requirements on the question of employment policy.
Mr President, the oral amendment can only be accepted if there are no objections.
Perhaps more than anyone else, the programme concerns young Europeans, those who will build our future on the basis of the diversity of European culture.
That position was: eastern enlargement as quickly as possible, Germany wants to pay less, and the German farmers should get more.
That is the real aim.I hope that this will become more widespread in the weeks and months to come.
The European Union will only succeed in the global food market in the area of high-quality produce.
Indeed, from now on, humanity is protected against any abusive exercise of sovereignty.
It is the responsibility of Member States to improve waste disposal, using alternatives to landfill, without penalising the taxpaying public.
I would also like to stress that harmonisation can only progress gradually, particularly if the relevant livestock production has hitherto been governed predominantly by national or regional rules.If we do not want this kind of dependency on imports, we shall have to implement urgent measures for energy production in the EU area.
In fact, as a Muslim, I should remind you that the 15th century after the Hegira has barely begun.After that, the British Government would be responsible for the way the citizens of Gibraltar exercise their right to vote, and that lies outside the Commission's competence.
Unfortunately again, a crisis meeting with the Dutch and French heads of state, who were effectively blocking each other with opposing candidates, failed to achieve an outcome.Nevertheless, he contrived to incorporate into his work - quite rightly, in my opinion - absolutely essential provisions to safeguard independence and transparency.
I would put it to Mr Spencer that he undervalues what has been achieved in the last year.
It is not rational to make a cut in real terms in research in 1999 and the beginning of the next century.In these countries a high proportion of people's incomes goes on food, even though food prices are relatively low.
Mr President, I should like to mention something we are forever requesting at Plenary sessions: that Members should refrain from using mobile phones, as this disrupts proceedings in the House.
It is an important and a negative development.
The Liberal Group is asking for a clear statement on how human rights policy is being implemented, either from you or from the Commission.
ApplauseWe, the European Parliament, will be doing everything we can to ensure that Agenda 2000 is adopted by the end of this legislature.
Applause
When the environmental policy is not adhered to, cross-compliance should be introduced as proposed in Agenda 2000.Mrs Schroedter certainly has understood what cohesion is.Should we get rid of these subsidies?
That is the best way of keeping the Member States' minds on the job.Outsiders must show restraint, including the European Council and the European Parliament.
Europe is disgracing itself by allowing civilians to be massacred and by serving the interests of tyrants.It was because of these fundamental shortcomings, which mean that the report fails to deal with a decisive element in the fight against drugs, that we abstained.EU regulations ought to be kept to a minimum.I believe environmental taxes and charges to be a key way of combating pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.In this connection statistics are immensely beneficial, usable and necessary.The techniques that are used range from misuse - the forging of signatures - through tampering with credit cards, to complete counterfeiting.
It is just for opening the procedure which then starts the real investigation.My own country used to be governed by a party that treated every summit meeting as though it was a combative exercise with our neighbours in the European Union.
But part of the work has been done.A man jumps a motorcycle into the air on a dirt road.
This exercise must result in a genuine internal reform of all the institutions at the same time to ensure that they remain coherent and effective as a whole.
Thirdly, in committee we laid down some conditions for selecting the companies to be funded, and I would ask the Commission to accept these.
We have a duty to contribute to the fight against poverty and towards the protection of acceptable social and environmental standards.
On this point, the European Parliament's claim of its right to be informed and consulted on international negotiations and bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements is significant and important.Speaking of sanctions, the Union might well commit itself to a ban on the export of arms to the two countries concerned.The ban on lead from 1 January 2000, as proposed in the Hautala report, will improve petrol and diesel quality.Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are very few areas where the quality and the future of the European integration process are really at stake.
Mr President, I must tell the Commissioner that we can reach agreement.Much has happened since then.When we approach the Council on these matters the Council always says this is a matter for the Commission, the Commission's responsibility.
We should therefore regard Agenda 2000 and the post-Kyoto climate strategy as the key to integrating the environment and sustainability into other policy areas, as stated in the Commission's communication.European monetary union is the first step.To enable euro banknote production to proceed smoothly prototypes were manufactured by eight different paper mills and ten different printing works in 1997.
In any event, this is a purely linguistic problem.
Above all, the draft Community budget for 1999 is a constructive step in the 1999 budget procedure.
They are the ones that dwell on industrial policies, policies that sustain and create wealth, business and jobs.
Even the experts could not manage to design coins which are easily recognisable to the blind and proof against fraud.Coordination and integration by means of a framework programme is desirable in order to coordinate the individual energy programmes.
Mr Funke, I am sure you will be able to explain this confusion.
