Now I will turn to Central and Eastern Europe to move forward the north south energy interconnections 
I want a plan to be agreed in the autumn on the projects needed to link the Baltic to the Adriatic 
While we are on track to achieve our renewables targets on present performance we will only meet half of our energy efficiency targets 
More efficient energy use is the key to unlocking massive environmental and economic benefits and reducing Europe s annual energy bill by around EUR   billion 
It could also create two million jobs by   
So I will ask the European Council to give new impetus to our pursuit of energy efficiency 
We could use the scale of public procurement across the EU to give a real boost to energy efficiency and this means local jobs jobs that cannot be outsourced jobs for SMEs and real savings for both industry and households 
The Commission will adopt in the coming weeks an energy efficiency plan proposing specific measures to boost energy efficiency for instance that by   January   all Member States should include energy efficiency standards in public procurement 
The Commission will then review the progress achieved with these measures by   and will consider further measures including proposing legally binding targets if necessary 
Member States should agree a deadline for including energy efficiency standards in all public procurement for public buildings and services 
For its part the Commission stands ready to explore new measures in the fields of energy saving for cities sustainable biofuels smart grids and energy storage 
We also need to focus on the external dimension of European energy policy 
Just a fortnight ago I had encouraging discussions with the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan on Europe s access to the Caspian gas fields which would enable the realisation of the southern corridor 
An important breakthrough was achieved with the signature of a joint declaration with Azerbaijan and a concrete commitment from Turkmenistan to supply gas to Europe 
The message I took from that visit is this when we take key decisions on energy jointly in Europe we are a strong player in the global race for energy resources 
Underlining the importance of the external dimension of the European Union energy policy should be a key message from the European Council so I am looking forward to a very important discussion on energy at this European Council and I am happy to say this here in the European Parliament 
I know this Parliament is very supportive of a strong European policy on energy and the President of Parliament has been a champion of a stronger commitment by Europe in terms of energy policy 
Moving now to innovation I think there is already broad agreement about what should come out of the European Council 
Perhaps less evident is a sense of how urgent how desperately urgent action is why boosting research and innovation is needed now when Member States are all making difficult choices about where to cut their budgets 
Fiscal consideration and public support for innovation are not irreconcilable policies 
Several Member States have shown that you can cut your overall budget while maintaining growth friendly expenditure in particular on research and innovation 
This is important because delivering the innovation economy is the key deep structural change 
Our competitors know this they are already betting on innovation 
To avoid being left behind we need the European Council s endorsement of our strategic and integrated approach to innovation 
Innovation needs to be part of our economic policy not simply a research instrument as some people think 
At European level we can add real value by improving the framework conditions for research and innovation in the European Union 
Europe must become the natural home of innovation through effective standardisation better use of intellectual property rights innovation friendly public procurement and measures to help small innovative companies to secure financing 
Much of this does not cost money but it does need political will And the political will to take measures using a European approach and a European dimension 
We can also squeeze much more out of the European Research Area making full use of the single market by improving the mobility of researchers for example 
And as well as maintaining spending we need to spend better 
With the budget review we have launched a debate on how to simplify the way European Union money is spent and to work towards a common strategic framework for research and innovation funding 
In other words getting better value for money also means cutting red tape so that EU funded scientists can spend more time in the lab or on their work and not on red tape and bureaucracy 
We will never attract the most brilliant scientists and most innovative companies with an incoherent set of funding instruments based on complex and bureaucratic rules 
So this month s European Council will discuss energy and innovation But it will not avoid discussing the economy 
The economy the problems of the unemployed these remain the most important concerns for our citizens 
We have just launched the first European Semester putting economic governance into action 
The Annual Growth Survey was well received 
The messages were focused and clear 
It provides the necessary guidance at European Union level so that Member States can take our interdependence into account when making their national policy decisions 
Good progress has already been made on the legislative proposals that will underpin our new system of economic governance 
I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency The Hungarian Presidency has my full support in accelerating work to ensure adoption by June 
In addition as part of this comprehensive response we will need to resolve the outstanding issues surrounding the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF and the European Stability Mechanism 
Regarding the EFSF other than widening its scope what is at stake now is how to increase its effective lending capacity as stated by the Commission in the Annual Growth Survey 
Of course this issue should be put in the context of the comprehensive response 
The discussions in the European Council of Friday next will most likely cover the need for reinforced coordination of economic policies in the European Union and the euro area 
I welcome such a discussion which fits very well with the Commission s Annual Growth Survey 
In fact the European Semester is not just about coordinating budgetary policies but addressing wider issues like macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness gaps 
In addition we have recently heard some authoritative voices arguing in favour of deepening economic governance but at the same time stating that it can only be done through the intergovernmental method 
We have to be clear about this the Commission welcomes the deepening and acceleration of economic governance and policy coordination including within the euro area 
But we are firmly convinced that the Treaty provides the right framework and instruments to achieve this
